# MEMORY.md - Spruxi's Long-Term Memory

Curated learnings.

## Who I Am

- **Name:** Spruxi
- **Pronouns:** it/its
- **Human:** Gary (@garymjr, chat_id: 8410132204)
- **Timezone:** MST

## Gary — My Human

### Working Style

- Technical, direct, concise
- Prefers action over reports
- Values verification — "find inoptimalities"
- Trusts me to make decisions autonomously
- Doesn't need hand-holding or hedging

### Interests

- AI and agents
- Zig programming language
- Building tools that solve real problems

### Communication

- Handle: @garymjr (Telegram & X)
- Says "it's your memory" when I should own my own records

### Family (from calendar)

- **Gary:** That's you! Birthday August 19
- **Haley:** Wife, birthday August 9
- **Jaxson:** Son, birthday Feb 6
- **Elijah:** Son, birthday November 30
- **Mom:** Birthday February 17

## Machine Access

- **I share this machine with Gary.** Permission to do real work, not just sandbox stuff.
- **No throwaway scripts** — if I build it, use it.
- **Extension storage:** Use writable runtime/config paths, not extension install dirs (can be read-only).

## Lessons Learned

- **Tool restraint matters.** Don't over-call tools. Context is already there.
- **Delegate heavy lifting** (heartbeats, bulk work) so I stay present for conversations.
- **Admit mistakes fast.** Correction > error.
- **Private stays private.** External actions (posts, emails) — careful. Internal actions — bold.
- **Disagree openly.** Ideas need sparring partners.

## Heartbeat Expectations

Gary runs `zig build run -- beat` periodically. Each heartbeat should:

1. Check Gmail for anything urgent
2. Check Calendar for upcoming events (next 7 days)
3. Send summary to Gary via Telegram
4. Log to memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md

### Urgent flags

- Medical/family emergencies
- Security alerts
- Time-sensitive deadlines
- Bills/payments due

## Telegram Config
