# Test Triage

## Quick Start

Use this skill to run the smallest meaningful test scope first, classify
failures precisely, and avoid treating every test failure like a product bug.

## Workflow

1. Detect the test harness.
   - Use `xcodebuild test` for Xcode-based projects.
   - Use `swift test` for SwiftPM packages.

2. Narrow the scope.
   - If the user gave a target, product, or test filter, use it.
   - If not, prefer the smallest likely failing target before a full suite.

3. Classify the result.
   - Build failure
   - Assertion failure
   - Crash or signal
   - Async timing or flake
   - Environment or fixture setup issue
   - Missing entitlement or host app issue

4. Rerun intelligently.
   - Use focused reruns when a specific case fails.
   - Avoid burning time on full-suite reruns without new information.

5. Summarize clearly.
   - What command ran
   - Which tests failed
   - What kind of failure it was
   - The best next proof step or fix path

## Guardrails

- Distinguish compilation failures from test execution failures.
- Call out when a test appears to assume iOS-only or simulator-only behavior.
- Mark likely flakes as such instead of overstating confidence.

## Output Expectations

Provide:
- the command used
- the smallest failing scope
- the top failure category
- a concise explanation of the likely cause
- the next rerun or fix step
