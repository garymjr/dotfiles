# Signing & Entitlements

## Quick Start

Use this skill when the failure smells like codesigning rather than compilation:
launch refusal, missing entitlement, invalid signature, sandbox mismatch,
hardened runtime confusion, or trust-policy rejection.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the bundle or binary.
   - Locate the `.app` or executable.
   - Identify the main binary inside `Contents/MacOS/`.

2. Read signing details.
   - Use `codesign -dvvv --entitlements :- <path>`.
   - Use `spctl -a -vv <path>` when Gatekeeper behavior matters.
   - Use `plutil -p` for entitlements or Info.plist inspection.

3. Classify the failure.
   - Unsigned or ad hoc signed
   - Wrong identity
   - Entitlement mismatch
   - Hardened runtime issue
   - App Sandbox issue
   - Nested code signing issue
   - Distribution/notarization prerequisite issue

4. Explain the minimum fix path.
   - Say exactly what is wrong.
   - Show the shortest set of validation or repair commands.
   - Distinguish local development problems from distribution problems.

## Useful Commands

- `codesign -dvvv --entitlements :- <app-or-binary>`
- `spctl -a -vv <app-or-binary>`
- `security find-identity -p codesigning -v`
- `plutil -p <path-to-entitlements-or-plist>`

## Guardrails

- Never invent missing entitlements.
- Do not conflate notarization with local debug signing.
- If the real issue is a build setting or provisioning profile, say so directly.

## Output Expectations

Provide:
- what artifact was inspected
- what signing state it is in
- the exact failure class
- the minimum fix or validation sequence
